## Introduction to Algorithms

This repository contains information and problem solutions related to the
(outstanding) [Introduction to Algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms)
book.

Feel free to comment on anything you see here. Just try not to look at my solutions
before you have done your best shot at solving a problem yourself. Learning comes from practice!

Have fun :-)

#### On formats and viewing

For problems which do not have an executable solution (i.e., problems that just require
you to perform some calculation or explain something), I have chosen to use [LATEX 2Îµ](http://www.latex-project.org/).
It is not the simplest format to read, but produces beautiful output, and most of
the content is left untouched.

I decided not to keep track of the compiled versions of the content in order not to
clutter the repository with binaries whenever I decide to update the source. However,
if you do not have a LATEX environment properly set and wish to see the output,
please take a look at the corresponding pull request (there should be one for each
chapter, roughly).  I plan to attach the compiled content of the answers there
whenever it involves LATEX. I am sorry for the trouble.

**Compiling the LATEX sources**

If you wish to compile the LATEX sources for the exercises, keep in mind that I use
the `clrs3e` LATEX package in most of them. You will need to download and install
it on your system in order to compile from source. The files and documentation can
be found [here](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrscode/).
